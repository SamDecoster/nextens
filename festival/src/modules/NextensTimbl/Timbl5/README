This is an extension to the fifth main release of Timbl.

While this is NOT a Beta version it may still contain some bugs or
behave not exactly as documented or expected. Comments and
bug-reports are welcome at: Timbl@uvt.nl. Updates and more info
may be found on our website: http://ilk.uvt.nl/ .

Please also read our Licensing information in licence.terms .

This software has been tested on:
- Sparc platform running Solaris 2.8
- Intel platform running several vesrions of Linux
- PPC platform running Darwin
- MIPS-SGI platform running IRIX 6.5

These systems used various versions of GCC (2.95.3 - 3.4.x).
But it is highly recommended to upgrade to at least GCC 3.2

Contents of this distribution:
- sources
- Licensing information ( License.terms )
- Makefile for Gnu Make
- example data files ( in the demos directory )
- documentation ( in the docs directory )

How to install:

- unpack the distribution:
  > gunzip Timbl.5.1.tar.gz
  > tar xvf Timbl.5.1.tar

- the package is now in the directory ./Timbl5. Go to that
  directory:
  > cd Timbl5

- make the Timbl executable by typing make:
  > make
 
  If GNU make is not your default make program, you probably need to
  type gmake or gnumake.

  Make will also create a sample client for a Timbl server (TimblClient).
  The demonstration programmes in the demos directory require a 
  separate make. Executables and object files are typically placed in 
  the cwd, except on Solaris systems, where they are placed in ./SPARC 
  for Sparc or ./X86 for Intel-Solaris.

- make sure that the Timbl program becomes accessible in your path:
  either: add the Timbl directory to your path
      or: move the program to your favourite bin directory,
          you might need to use the rehash command after that.

- you can test your build using the provided example files:
  > Timbl -f demos/dimin.train -t demos/dimin.test
