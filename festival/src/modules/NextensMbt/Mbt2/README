These systems used various versions of GCC (2.95 - 3.3).

Contents of this distribution:
- sources
- Licensing information ( License.terms )
- Makefile for Gnu Make
- example data files ( eindh.* , test.tok )
- documentation ( docs/Mbt_2.0_Manual.pdf )

MBT assumes a compiled version of TiMBL (Tilburg Memory-Based Learner)
version 5.0 installed on your system. Please refer to
http://ilk.uvt.nl to download TiMBL.

How to install:

- unpack the distribution:
  > gunzip Mbt.2.0.tar.gz
  > tar xvf Mbt.2.0.tar

- the package is now in the directory ./Mbt2. Go to that
  directory:
  > cd Mbt2

- edit the variable TIMBLPATH in the Makefile. This variable should be
  set to the directory where a compiled Timbl 5.0 system resides.

- make the Mbtg and Mbt executables by typing make:
  > make
 
  If GNU make is not your default make program, you probably need to
  type gmake or gnumake.  MBT will not build with other make variants
  than GNU make!

- to run Mbt or Mbtg from anywhere, make sure that they become
  accessible in your path.
  either: add the Mbt2 directory to your path
      or: move the programs to your favourite bin directory in your path;
          you might need to use the rehash command after that.

- please refer to the Reference Guide ( docs/Mbt_2.0_Manual.pdf ) to
  start working with the Mbtg and Mbt programs.
